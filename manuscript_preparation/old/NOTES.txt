***Note that "new" is the x-axis because it is the technically correct form

slopes and intercepts (and graphs) for

Total daily C Gain
lm(medlyn ~ new)

Total daily photosynthesis
lm(medlyn ~ new)

Total daily A/R
lm(medlyn ~ new)

units are all gC plant-1 day-1

can also check if:

total daily C gain difference (medlyn - new)
correlates with sd(Temp by DOY * Location)

In theory, the small differences in temp response
parameters should be exacerbated by environmental
variation
